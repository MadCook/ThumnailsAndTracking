Grab top directory you are running from
Probably from config file

Accept param pointing at new config file

Two features probably best if done together:
Piece together a json with directory structure and image names in
 each directory maintaining structure
For each image make a thumbnail of the image and place in identical directory
  structure
  Subpoint: Check if thumbnail already exists and don't override it. If
   thumbnail exists read in tags to above json

Ideas and approaches:
- Allow for existing json to simplify number of checks for existing files
  + Speed
  - Complexity of algorithm
- Need to make sure that you unzip files as few times as possible
Json object needs to be in a format that maintains structure of directory


Ideas for json:
{
  "directroyNameA": {
      "files": ['fileName.png', 'fileName.jpg']
      "tags": ['a', 'b'] # Means all files get tagged :/
      "subDirectory": {...}
  }

  "directoryNameB": {
      "directory": True
      "objects": [
          {
            'directory': true,
            "objects": [..]
            'name': 'subB'
          }, {
            'directory': false,
            'name': 'image.png'
            'tags': ['','']
          }
      ]
      "tags": ['','']
  }
}


Or:
[('path/fileName', ['tags'])....]OR:
[{'path':'', 'fileName':'', 'tags': [...]}]


Steps:
 Read in json created by thumnailcreationTool
Start up a latex doc named by name from config
 Iterate through each object First section Artist name
 Atleast down one if not two of the area so:
 artist/folder/subfolder/remainder
 section/ subheader/ subsubheader? (Look in pyLatex for this ability)
 then for each mark as
 [image,    image,    image,    image,    image]
 [remainder,remainder,remainder,remainder,remainder]
 I'm thinking lines of 5 but make that a config choice.

I'd like to chose depth as a param as well but probably limitted by pyLatex
